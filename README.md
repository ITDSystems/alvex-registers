Alvex Registers component
================================
Brings new component to Alfresco sites to store metadata-only nodes (case management, transaction content management, extended Alfresco Data Lists).

![image](http://www.itdhq.com/img/registers1.png)

Supports filtering, configuring columns to show in the datagrid, export to XLS.

Currently contains two types of registers out-of-the-box: contracts and invoices. Can be extended by custom types by creating content models, inherited from alvexreg:registerItem.

Later will be added integrations with workflows and tasks.
